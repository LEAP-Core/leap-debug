- Take advantage of the existing RRR control logic and run the test from
  software.  Parameters are now passed over RRR and each test then reverts
  to waiting for a command.  Removed a bunch of hardware control logic.
  (Now it is easy to build a shorter test in the software controller when
  running in Bluesim.)

- Eliminated 2nd stride 128 test.

- Apply a trivial mix function to data to force a test that values stored
  are != the address of the value.

- The printf in the hardware side isn't really necessary anymore, since test
  results could be returned via RRR.  Left the printf for now.

- Restore ACP debugger.  Somebody reconfigured it for ML605 and checked it in.
  (It wasn't me.)  The ACP version is still broken because parameters were
  added for DDR3 memory that the generic driver reads but doesn't find for
  ACP's memory.

Refactored mem-perf test to use rings.  Point-to-point links made
scaling the code to more interesting multifpga systems difficult.
This change only introduces the rings - it does not change the code
structure.  More refactoring will be needed to support single/multiple
FPGA builds.  This will occur shortly.

Finished refactoring the memory performance test.  Now adding extra
scratchpads requires only adding and slightly modifying the test
wrapper code, as opposed to large amounts of code replication.

Fixed multiple horiffic bugs in the platform debugger code.

1) Changed apms to target the external RAM memory on the various
boards.  Previously we were targeting the BRAM memory.

2) Fixed latency calculation.  Latency must be measured for each
memory op, as opposed to just measuring the total test time.

3) Added throughput calculation - or renamed "latency" to throughput.

4) Increased the number of requests in-flight.  The buggy "latency"
calculation was misleading us as to the true properties of our memory
system.
